When handling the server response from a save operation, resolving the return value should be case-insensitive.

The gridponent function doesn't handle exceptions.
Should we use promises to do this?
Or should we just provide a fail callback?

The mechanism we're using to populate the model for the read template doesn't work on the initial read.
That's because it gets populated in the change event handler.

Currently it's not possible to pass a url to an event delegate call:
gridponent('#theGrid').rowSelected('http://server/app/controller/action/{{id}}');
Should this be supported?

Can we isolate the controllers commandHandler from the editors? Don't like relying on differences in command value.

What happens if a grid is rendered twice? Make sure the original is disposed if this happens.

Add page size config option (default to 25).

Empty table template

Allow the http module to be configured to use JSON or application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
