The mechanism we're using to populate the model for the read template doesn't work on the initial read.
That's because it gets populated in the change event handler.
Instead, we should unbind the toolbar just like any form.

ServerPager.read should probably be sending an HTTP GET instead of a POST.
But then the URL template idea wouldn't make much sense because the requestModel would be added to the URL anyway.
And why would we want to split the request parameters between the URL and the body?
There's also the problem of supporting routes: controller/action/{{id}}.
If the id is POSTed, will the router pick it up?
If we use a URL template with a POST, the values in the URL should be excluded from the body.
But that'd be brittle.
Should we create a way to configure the HTTP verbs for CRUD?

Currently it's not possible to pass a url to an event delegate call:
gridponent('#theGrid').rowSelected('http://server/app/controller/action/{{id}}');
Should this be supported?

Add page size config option (default to 25).

Empty table template

Allow the http module to be configured to use JSON or application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
