The mechanism we're using to populate the model for the read template doesn't work on the initial read.
That's because it gets populated in the change event handler.
Instead, we should unbind the toolbar just like any form.

Currently it's not possible to pass a url to an event delegate call:
gridponent('#theGrid').rowSelected('http://server/app/controller/action/{{id}}');
Should this be supported?

Add page size config option (default to 25).

Empty table template

Allow the http module to be configured to use JSON or application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
